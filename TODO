- add system_to_rtc()
- add rtc_to_system()
- add date_time() to get stringified date in DateTime format
- add temp, plus its conversion

- get/set 12/24

- handle cases where someone tries to set a 12 hr clock to 24 hours, where
  the time is currently > 12

  # disable

  (if time > 12, subtract 12 from time and enable(set) pm flag)
  Technically, if time <= 12, am/pm flag should already be disabled

  # enable

  - fetch am/pm
  - if am and hour = 12, set hour to 0
  - if am and < 12, leave alone
  - if pm and hour = 12, leave alone
  - if pm and hour < 12, add 12 hours


 - bounds checking on all set calls per register field
